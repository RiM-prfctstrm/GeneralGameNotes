Some games will be so good/personally interesting that I will do complete studies of them.

CONTROL
|-Player must have sufficient ammo for throwing
||-Everything not nailed to the floor has physics
||-If worse comes to worst, you can tear out a chunk of the building
|||-Doing so can cause physical damage that changes the model of the level
|
|-Open world even though inside a single building
||-Areas are cordoned off so you can go through the campaign without getting lost
||-Campaign trail has side areas to do side quests at
|
|-Different areas of the same building have to be visually distinct
||-Each sector is devoted to a different purpose
||-Different set of props for each level
||-Lighting has different colors in each area
|
|-Damage carries over from Astral Plane
||-Ludically reinforces idea that AP is not some sort of dream space but an actual location
||-Makes combat  encounters immediately afterword much more stressful
|
|-SIDEQUESTS
||-Major ones unlock new ablities, meaning their rewards directly affect how you play the campaign
||-Objects of power demonstrate their abilities in the puzzles to unlock them so you're already familiar with them once you have them
||-Board Countermeasures are the kind of quest you complete just by playing
|
|-SEIZE ABILITY
||-Concept of friendly combatants introduced by the blue health bars on the guys in fron of the X-ray machine
||-You can move while seizing, so it isn't a risky maneuver
||-Seized enemies die on a timer so they aren't overpowered
||-Seized enemies fight each other, probably to make encounters end faster if they're all that remain.
|
|-MISC
||-Checkpoints and fast travel points are the same
||-Railings break so as not to obstruct projectiles
||-Inventory is preserved over death
||-Radios can't be picked up or thrown, probably to prevent sound calculations from getting too complex.
||-You respawn in the Astral Plane if you die there, probably so you don't have to repeat O.O.P. puzzles

DAEMON X MACHINA
|-Immortals aren't fun
||-Bullet sponges
||-Health is hard to see
||-Almost never react to attacks
||-Mostly target NPC allies
||-Easy to dodge attacks
||-All of this combines to make it feel like you're attacking a giant that doesn't realize you exist
|
|-Arsenal minibosses are better
||-Hardish to hit and hard to avoid
||-Deal significant damage
|
|-Welcome to YOUR Battlefield
||-Love this phrase
||-Gives world-saving/corparate-serving missions personal emotional investment
||-Can be interpreted to mean you metaphorically own the battlefield and thus are unstoppable while on it
||-Can also be interpreted to mean the battlefield is literally yours, so you must protect it from AIs
||-Just the coolest little detail
|
|-GAMEPLAY
||-Clearly defined gameplay loop: Fight enemies to collect parts, use parts to customize mech, use customized mech to fight enemies
||-Weak, numbers-based targets in shooters are boring to fight
||-Every weapon has a different and distinct function, encouraging swapping between them mid-battle
||-Post-battle timer gives you a chance to heal and collect loot
||-Can be easy to accidentally back out of the mission area w/out noticing
||-Entirely ground based enemies with only melee attacks are pointless when you can fly as much as you want
|
|-STORY
||-Most missions have dialogue playing throughout, at least early on. Seems like it's more about listening to the story than gameplay
||-Emotional music clashes awkwardly with text message-based cutscenes
||-Introducing characters then immediately switching to new ones without developement is a bad way to do an ensemble cast
|||-Falls in the same trap with plot threads. All that's clear is who's good and who's bad in each individual mission
||
||-Never mentions the difference between the minion (AI) and the master (Immortal)
|
|-MISC
||-Excessively formfitting suits for women is sexist
||-Artist's extreme innocence/exuberance feels like a racial stereotype
|||-Other black characters like Painkiller don't seem to be stereotypes

TEAM FORTRESS 2
|-Different classes can be used to adapt to the flow of battle or personal performance
|-Class limits ensure that teams stay balanced
|
|-SNIPER
||-Glass cannon class. Works best in concealed spots with good views
|
|-PYRO
||-Air blast seems designed specifically to counter soldier's rocket. Interesting for an offensive to counter another offensive
