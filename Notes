Some games will be so good/personally interesting that I will do complete studies of them.


CONTROL
|-Player must have sufficient ammo for throwing
||-Everything not nailed to the floor has physics
||-If worse comes to worst, you can tear out a chunk of the building
|
|-Different areas of the same building have to be visually distinct
||-Each sector is devoted to a different purpose
||-Different set of props for each level
||-Lighting has different colors in each area
|
|-Damage carries over from Astral Plane
||-Ludically reinforces idea that AP is not some sort of dream space but an actual location
||-Makes combat  encounters immediately afterword much more stressful
|
|-MISC
||-Checkpoints and fast travel points are the same
||-Railings break so as not to obstruct projectiles

DAEMON X MACHINA
|-Clearly defined gameplay loop: Fight enemies to collect parts, use parts to customize mech, use customized mech to fight enemies.
|
|-Weak, numbers-based targets in shooters are boring to fight.
|
|-Every weapon has a different and distinct function, encouraging swapping between them mid-battle
