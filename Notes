Some games will be so good/personally interesting that I will do complete studies of them.


CONTROL
|-Player must have sufficient ammo for throwing
||-Everything not nailed to the floor has physics
||-If worse comes to worst, you can tear out a chunk of the building
|
|-Different areas of the same building have to be visually distinct
||-Each sector is devoted to a different purpose
||-Different set of props for each level
||-Lighting has different colors in each area
|
|-Damage carries over from Astral Plane
||-Ludically reinforces idea that AP is not some sort of dream space but an actual location
||-Makes combat  encounters immediately afterword much more stressful
|
|-Sidequests unlock new abilities
||-Rewards directly affect your future play during the main campaign
||-Makes doing them worthwhile
|
|-MISC
||-Checkpoints and fast travel points are the same
||-Railings break so as not to obstruct projectiles

DAEMON X MACHINA
|-Immortals aren't fun
||-Bullet sponges
||-Health is hard to see
||-Almost never react to attacks
||-Mostly target NPC allies
||-Easy to dodge attacks
||-All of this combines to make it feel like you're attacking a giant that doesn't realize you exist
|
|-GAMEPLAY
||-Clearly defined gameplay loop: Fight enemies to collect parts, use parts to customize mech, use customized mech to fight enemies
||-Weak, numbers-based targets in shooters are boring to fight
||-Every weapon has a different and distinct function, encouraging swapping between them mid-battle
||-Post-battle timer gives you a chance to heal and collect loot
||-Can be easy to accidentally back out of the mission area w/out noticing
|
|-STORY
||-Most missions have dialogue playing throughout, at least early on. Seems like it's more about listening to the story than gameplay
||-Emotional music clashes awkwardly with text message-based cutscenes
||-Introducing characters then immediately switching to new ones without developement is a bad way to do an ensemble cast
|
|-MISC
||-Excessively formfitting suits for women is sexist
||-Artist's extreme innocence/exuberance feels like a racial stereotype

TEAM FORTRESS 2
|-Different classes can be used to adapt to the flow of battle or personal performance
|-Class limits ensure that teams stay balanced
|
|-SNIPER
||-Glass cannon class. Works best in concealed spots with good views
|
|-PYRO
||-Air blast seems designed specifically to counter soldier's rocket. Interesting for an offensive to counter another offensive
